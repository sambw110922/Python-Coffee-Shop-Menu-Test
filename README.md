# Python-Coffee-Shop-Menu-Test
This was a test to make a main menu in Python. It is for a fake coffee shop and simulates an experience.

The menu has 5 options to start with and some have sub options like with coffee, there are different types of coffee.

This project was just a learning experiment while I learn Python. It is not meant to be properly used for anything.
